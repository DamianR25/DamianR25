Hello, I'm @DamianR25! I am currently a computer science student at Towson University.

I am interested in a variety of topics including gaming, food, the outdoors, and computers. I find joy in exploring new games, trying out new recipes, and discovering new outdoor destinations. Additionally, I am passionate about computer science and technology, and I enjoy keeping up with the latest developments in the field.

Currently, I am focused on learning computer science at Towson University, and in my free time, I am self-studying JavaScript, Python, and eventually Tensorflow. I believe that continuous learning is essential to keep up with the ever-changing technological landscape.

I am also open to collaborating on any exciting projects related to computer science and technology. If you would like to reach out to me, you can contact me via my student email: drozyck1@students.towson.edu.
